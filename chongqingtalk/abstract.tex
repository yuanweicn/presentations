Title: On a new class of non selfadjoint algebras.\\


In 1960, Kadison and Singer initiate the study of non selfadjoint
algebras of bounded operators on Hilbert spaces. They introduce 
and study ``triangular algebras,'' subalgebras of C$^*$-algebra whose
diagonal is maximal abelian selfadjoint. Recently, motivated by
their work, we propose a generalization of the concept of ``triangular 
algebras,'' and introduce a new class of non selfadjoint algebras. These
algebras combine triangularity and von Neumann algebra properties in their
structure.

In this talk, I will present some results on this new class of non selfadjoint
algebras. The talk will begin with a gentle introduction to the 
theory of finite von Neumann algebras, concentrating on the
concept of the hypterfinite II$_1$ factor. Then we will construct and study
``maximal triangular algebras'' with hypterfinite factors as their diagonals. 
If time permitted, we may discuss some facts concerning the ``double triangle
operator algebras.''
